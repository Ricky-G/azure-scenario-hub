## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

When contributing scenarios or templates:

1. **Review Dependencies**: Ensure all external dependencies are from trusted sources
2. **Minimize Permissions**: Use least-privilege principles in IAM configurations
3. **Secrets Management**: Never hardcode secrets, keys, or sensitive information
4. **Network Security**: Implement proper network segmentation and access controls
5. **Encryption**: Use encryption in transit and at rest where applicable

### For Users

When deploying scenarios:

1. **Review Templates**: Always review Bicep/ARM templates before deployment
2. **Customize Security**: Adapt security configurations to your requirements
3. **Monitor Resources**: Implement proper monitoring and alerting
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep deployed resources and templates updated
5. **Access Control**: Implement proper RBAC and conditional access policies
