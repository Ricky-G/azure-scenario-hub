# Azure Scenario Hub 🚀

A collection of ready-to-deploy Azure architecture scenarios. Infrastructure-as-code templates for common patterns, designed for rapid deployment and learning.

> **Note**: These scenarios are designed for experimentation, learning, and lab environments. For production deployments, consider using [Azure Verified Modules](https://aka.ms/avm) and follow your organization's security and compliance requirements.

## 🎯 What is this?

A collection of Azure infrastructure templates for experimentation and learning. Each scenario provides complete working code for common architectural patterns, eliminating the need to build from scratch.

### Use cases:
- **Application Development** - Deploy infrastructure quickly to focus on application logic
- **Architecture Validation** - Test designs with working reference implementations  
- **Learning Azure** - Hands-on examples of Azure service integrations
- **Rapid Prototyping** - Pre-built infrastructure for PoCs and experiments
